Things that I need to do
1. Get the distance (haversine?) of each item to a ward centroid
   a. Keep a dictionary of item category occurences for each ward
   b. Assign each ward category rankings 
   c. Demographics to Categories?   

Load wards into a dictionary
Load centroids into matrix

[[X1, Y1],
[X2, Y2],
[X3, Y3]]

For every item (2500 items), extract the geographical coordinates
Get the nearest ward it belongs to
Increment the entry in the ward dictionary by 1

Ward dictionary
Key: Ward number
Value: A dictionary of category occurences

Result: The most common category from the wards 

Conclusions so far: 
2500 data points, 888 without any geotags, therefore it's still a little sparse distributed over 44 wards
